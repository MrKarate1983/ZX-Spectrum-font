# zxSpectrumPixelFont
the classic ZXSpectrum 48k rom font converted to modern formats

you will find 4 folders, "strict" folders contains the basic 96 character set with lots of modern glyphs missing, like the ñ and such.

the "expanded" folders contains a comprehensive expanded modern character set that will cover most of your uses, like the ñ, `, ´, €, ¿,  etc

The "inverted" folders contain the exact same fonts but in reverse, emulating the inverted "selected" style where everything white was black, and vice-versa.

the font is an exact rendition, at 8px you will have a perfect zxSpectrum character onscreen. x2 sizes are recommended to prevent blurry aliasing.

this font doesn't contain the blocky characters since bitFontMaker2 only supported actual letters

i've included the source code for bitFontMaker2 as well

in the future I will expand the family with the condensed version, where characters were 4 pixels width.
